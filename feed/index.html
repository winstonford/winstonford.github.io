<p>After working with complex aquaponics systems, I decided to design and build an eco system that does not require pumps, filters, lights, and all the electronics and power needed to automate and drive them. The one below is fresh water. I’ve also made some with saltwater. I don&#8217;t add food, and I don’t change the water, though I do top it off. These little drops of water are kind of like earth, they have everything needed to sustain life. Just add sunlight.</p>

<p>Competing in a challenge run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, I led a small team&nbsp;to design a way for insects to help&nbsp;solve a health problem. &nbsp;Pit latrines are the most popular “bathroom” in the majority nations. &nbsp;The problem is that many cannot afford to have them emptied. &nbsp;When monsoons come, the latrines overflow. &nbsp;The result is massive health problems. &nbsp;By allying with insects, the latrines take longer to fill. &nbsp;For more info, visit the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180822023507/http://blogs.lshtm.ac.uk/sanitationventures/innovation/bsf-toilet-design-workshop/" target="_blank">Sanitation Ventures</a></p>

<p>Urban Feed Co is a project to produce sustainable livestock feed from insects that eat wide variety of nutrient wastes. These insects are called black soldier flies, or hermetic illucens, and while native to the tropics, they now live on every inhabited continent. The insect larvae are 30-50% protein. They contain lauric acid, also a major constituent in coconut oil, which kills harmful pathogens like bacteria, viruses and fungi.
