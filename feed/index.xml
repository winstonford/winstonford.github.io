<p>While I like the notion of universal basic income, it begs the question: who signs the checks? The philosophy behind Canopy is to make products that make use of universal local resources, starting with the sun. Often times, it’s right outside the window. And since law requires that every bedroom have an opening for egress, the window seemed like a good place to start collecting that sun. So we designed, made, and tested a number of prototypes to do just that: capture and store solar power in the bedroom window to power the daily essentials.</p>

<p>Competing in a challenge run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, I led a small team&nbsp;to design a way for insects to help&nbsp;solve a health problem. &nbsp;Pit latrines are the most popular “bathroom” in the majority nations. &nbsp;The problem is that many cannot afford to have them emptied. &nbsp;When monsoons come, the latrines overflow. &nbsp;The result is massive health problems. &nbsp;Using 3D designs skills and in-depth knowledge about an insect Hermetia illucens gained in the Urban Feed Co chapter, I figured we had a shot at solving the problem. One of the requirements, was that the innovation be fabricated with local materials. This is where the local craftsman played a big part. In short, by allying with these insects, the latrines take longer to fill. &nbsp;This means less disease, saving millions in healthcare. We tied for third place. The winning design was not produced with local materials.</p>

<p>Urban Feed Co is a project to produce sustainable livestock feed from insects that eat wide variety of nutrient wastes. These insects are called black soldier flies, or hermetia illucens, and while native to the tropics, they now live on every inhabited continent. The insect larvae are 30-50% protein. They contain lauric acid, also a major constituent in coconut oil, which kills harmful pathogens like bacteria, viruses and fungi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At left in the photo above is Dr. Robert Logan, Direct of Research at the College of Arts, Science, and Education in Portland, Jamaica, a great mentor. The college bought one of our units and we donated our time to conduct a study with the students in the photo. One of the highlights was developing a way for the students to log data on old school “dumb” phones. They would text a message with a few bits of info: weight of food, weight of bugs, temperature and pH. A service would strip this data from the email and send it to a simple script I wrote in php. The script would append a line to a .csv file on the server. And finally, a google spreadsheets function would grab this data from the server and update the sheets and charts so the team could analyze progress.</p>

<p>After working with complex aquaponics systems, I decided to design and build an eco system that does not require pumps, filters, lights, and all the electronics and power needed to automate and drive them. The one below is fresh water. I’ve also made some with saltwater. I don’t add food, and I don’t change the water, though I do top it off. These little drops of water are kind of like earth, they have everything needed to sustain life. Just add sunlight.</p>
